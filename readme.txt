The course, helped me translate data analysis questions into SQL queries and develop practical skills from realistic experiences with two different big business databases, using two different database formats. One data set, from a start-up called Dognition, is a MySQL database containing tables of over 1 million rows. 
The other data set, from Dillard’s, is a Teradata database containing tables with over a hundred million rows.
